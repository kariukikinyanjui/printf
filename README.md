This is a group project of two. I'll be working with 0xUzezi.

We will be creating a working printf function.

What is a printf function?

The printf function is a commonly used function in programming languages like C, C++, and other languages influenced by the C programming language. It stands for "print formatted" and is primarily used to display output on the screen or write formatted text to a file.

The printf function takes a format string as its first argument, which specifies the desired output format, and any additional arguments that provide the values to be formatted and displayed. The format string contains placeholders, known as format specifiers, which are replaced with the corresponding values from the additional arguments.
